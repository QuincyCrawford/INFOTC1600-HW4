# Video Games
Video games has always been a big hobby of mine. I has always been my favorite way to unwind and relax. I enjoy a variety of genera such as Sports, Fantasy, War Strategy, Rouge-Likes and more.

My favorite franchises are

1. Fire Emblem
: *Fantasy War Strategy Game that I find has very good storytelling and Appeal to replay the game*
2. Civilization
: *History based War/City Building Strategy where no two games are the same*
3. Rock Band
: *Music and Rhythm game that provides a fun challenge with music I like*

I have been playing many of these games for most of my life and I think each in some way or another has shaped me into who I am
