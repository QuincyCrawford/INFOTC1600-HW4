# IT Future

I knew from when I built my first computer in middle school I wanted to work in tech and i am so fortunate that desire has brought me to where I am today. I have been very lucky to already have some experince in both working a internship in a general IT role as well as hsving two **CompTIA** certifications

after school I would like to work in either Cyber Security or a related field
