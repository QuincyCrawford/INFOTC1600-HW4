# Sporting

I find myself interested in a variety of sports. Mostly because I have always felt I pick up sports very easily. I have a favorite team in almost every major sport in the US. 

** They are the following **

- Kansas City Chiefs - Football
- Minnesota Vikings - Football
- Utah Jazz - Basketball
- KC Royals - Baseball
- Colorado Rockies - Baseball
- STL Blues - Hockey
- and of course all of the Mizzou Sporting events/teams

It has always been a bonding point for my dad, brother, as well as many of my closest friends. Its something that I hope I can continue as I move into the future. I have a few bucketlist type items that I have in relation to sports that I would like to get done as well
